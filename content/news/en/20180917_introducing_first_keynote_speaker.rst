Our first keynote will be given by Viviane Pons. This keynote will be in english, saturday, October 6th, at 9h30, in Byron amphitheater.

Viviane has a position as a maître de conférence, i.e., associate professor, at Paris-Sud University. Her research is within the scope of algebraic combinatorics. She studies partially ordered sets of combinatorial objects such as the weak order on permutations and the Tamari lattice. She is also interested in mathematical software development and computer exploration. She is an active contibutor of the SageMath software. She teaches algorithmic and computing to all levels from licence to master.

She uses Python daily in her research as she could explain in her talk "Experimental pure mathematics" given to PyConFR and PyCon US in 2014 and 2015. 

She takes part in developping and diffusing the open-source software SageMath, written in Python. This is how she discovered open-source philosophy and the community that goes with. Since 2015, she is part of OpenDreamKit project for developping Ope Source in mathematics, and where she she is responsible for dissemination. As so, she organizes events for teaching and promoting Sage. Interested by diversity questions within scientific and open source communities, she is responsible with Anna-Livia Gomart of chapter PyLadies Paris.

As both a scientist and a developer, she will discuss the values that motivate her work in both worlds. I will also describe the common challenges that we face and how we can get better.
