Since 2007, the French Python Association (AFPy) organizes an annual meeting gathering Python users. They meet to speak about their experiences, to learn from each other and to show their latest discovering during workshops, presentations and meetings.

The PyConFr is the best way to discover Python language, to go further using it, to meet libraries and tools authors, and to simply meet during a week-end.

This year, PyConFr will be held in Lille from 4th to 7th of October 2018, and hosted by `IMT Lille Douai <http://imt-lille-douai.fr/>`_.

The PyConFr gathers 400 participants each day, and no less than 70 presentations and workshops:

- conferences, targeting all levels, allow to discover many different uses of Python,
- sprints allow to improve open source and free projects.

Sprints will take place on 4th and 5th of October. Conferences and workshops will take place on 6th and 7th of October.

You want to share an experience about Python? You wish to show your latest project to the community? Ask for help? This is the good time: the call for proposla is now open until the 30th of June! If you are a newcomer or a skilled talker, don't hesitate to propose a topic: PyConFr is about you before everything else :).

We accept long (50 min) and short presentations, and some workshops (please tell us their duration).

Here are some suggestions about what you can propose:

- Python in education: tips and tricks to learn or teach with Python;
- Internet, the Web and Python;
- crypto: encryption and private life;
- scientific Python: computation, statistics, machine learning;
- at the heart of Python: packaging, libraries, testing, profiling, binding;
- around Python: provisioning, databases, JavaScript frameworks;
- frameworks and applications: Django, Odoo, Openstack;
- Python in real: 3D printing, Internet of things, computer numerical control;
- Python now: Python 3 et asyncio;
- Python in the future: Python 3.7, Pypy;
- Libre Software with Python: your making;
- the community: diversity, local meetings, conference organizing;
- and also, anything that you could think about ;).

Thanks to make a proposal at https://cfp-2018.pycon.fr/cfp/ before 30th of June 2018 at 23h59 (Europe/Paris)!
