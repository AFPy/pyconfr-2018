Since 2007, the French Python Association (AFPy) organize an annual meeting gathering Python users. They meet to speak about their experiences, to learn from each other and to show their latest discovering during workshop, presentations and meetings.

The PyConFr is the best mean to discover Python language, to go further using it, to meet libraries and tools authors, and simply to meet during a week end.

This yaer, PyConFr will be held in Lille from 4th to 7th of October 2018, and hosted by `IMT Lille Douai <http://imt-lille-douai.fr/>`_.

The PyConFr gather 400 participants each day, et no less than 70 presentations and workshops :
