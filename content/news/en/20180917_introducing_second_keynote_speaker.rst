Our second keynote will be given by Julien Palard. This keynote will be in english, saturday, October 6th, at 18h00, in Byron amphitheater.

Julien teaches Python and does consultancy at cri-paris.org, supinternet.fr, meltygroup.com, and in many other places as a freelance.

He manages french translation of Python documentation, and help other countries to begin with the translation of Python doc.

This keynote is about searching, finding, and maybe understanding how Python developers make their choices in face of alternatives. We're told "There should be one-- and preferably only one --obvious way to do it." let's stop doing our "own way". I'll try to answer simple questions like "Is the consensus is to use pytest or unittest?" and tricker questions.
