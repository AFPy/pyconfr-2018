Our second keynote will be given by Julien Palard on Saturday, October 6th, at 6:00 PM, in the Byron amphitheater. This keynote will be in English.

Julien teaches Python and is a consultant for cri-paris.org, supinternet.fr, meltygroup.com, as a well as for a number of other projects as a freelance.

He manages French translation of Python documentation, and help other countries to begin with the translation of Python doc.

This keynote is about searching, finding, and maybe understanding how Python developers make their choices when facing alternatives. We're told, "There should be one-- and preferably only one --obvious way to do it." Let's stop doing our "own way". I'll try to answer simple questions like "Is the consensus is to use pytest or unittest?" and trickier questions.
