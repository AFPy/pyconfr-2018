  .. container::

     Algoo c'est une boîte. Qui on est, ce qu'on fait, c'est pas vraiment
     important, là. Ce qui compte, c'est surtout de **participer à PyConFR**.

     Certains proposent des sprints, d'autres des présentations, d'autre encore
     donnent un coup de pouce financier… et ce qui est bien, c'est qu'on peut
     cumuler !

     Finalement, on retrouve un peu l'esprit du libre : chacun contribue comme
     il peut/veut. La manière la plus simple de contribuer à PyconFR, c'est
     tout simplement d'y participer. Et si vous faites plus, c'est encore
     mieux !

     De notre côté, nous animerons sans doute un sprint pour interconnecter
     Tracim avec Collabora Online (ou un équivalent). (Note : si vous ne
     connaissez pas Tracim, `j'en ai parlé dans une dépêche LinuxFR en janvier
     dernier
     <https://linuxfr.org/news/tracim-socle-libre-du-travail-en-equipe-sort-en-v1-0>`_. Un
     atelier `Hapic <https://pypi.org/project/hapic/>`_\  ? Nope : on s'y est
     pris top tard :-s.

     Ah, et j'allais oublier : si vous hésitez à venir, à proposer un sprint,
     une présentation, voire à donner un petit coup de pouce financier… alors
     un conseil : n'hésitez pas !
