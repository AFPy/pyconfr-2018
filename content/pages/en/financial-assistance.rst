    AFPy offers financial assistance for students or persons whose resources do not
    allow to come to PyConFr. To apply, write an e-mail to the AFPy treasurer
    (`tresorier@afpy.org`_) explaining briefly:

    - your current status (student, looking for a job...)
    - the reason for your participation (attending conferences, sprints,
      presentation of a project...)
    - a rough estimate of the cost of your journey to PyConFr (travel and
      accomodation)
    - any other information you deem necessary

    You must not exceed 400 words in your application. If you are accepted, you will
    receive a maximum of 200€ if you come from Europe, or 400€ if you come from
    outside Europe, corresponding to a maximum refund of 75% of your transport and
    accomodation costs.

    Applications must be sent to `tresorier@afpy.org`_ before September 1st.
