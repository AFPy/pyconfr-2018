Venue
=====

We recommend 2 areas to those who do not know Lille.

Next to the city
----------------

If you want to spend the night in bars and other festive places, you should look
for an accomodation in the city-centre of Lille. That's where you'll find
animation!

Next to science
---------------

If you are more reasonable, there is a cluster of hotels in the *Parc de la
Haute Borne*, on the other side of the campus (20 minutes walk / 5 minutes by
car).

You can also opt for an `AirBNB`_ in the neighbourhoods of Villeneuve d'Ascq.

Note: scientists can also party in town but they'll have leave their mates
around midnight to catch the last subway :).
