Code of conduct
===============

As an event organised by the Francophone Python Association (AFPy), `the code of
conduct`_ carried by the association does apply.

AFPy Code
---------

The goal of AFPy is to promote the Python programming language among the widest
possible audience. We diffuse our knowledge and are open to external
contributions because diversity, mutual attention, solidarity and democracy
increase the potential of AFPy and each one of its members. That’s why we
encourage the participation of all members of the Python community, or wishing
to be part of it, in any event we (co-)organize. AFPy wishes anyone interested
to be welcome in a pleasant and meaningful way.

AFPy therefore expects each member of the association to show respect and
courtesy toward other members of the association and people met during any event
organized by the association.

This text is inspired by the code of conduct established by the Ada Initiative
and by the French anti-discrimination law.

The « short » version
+++++++++++++++++++++

AFPy wishes to avoid any type of discrimination, whether based on gender, sexual
orientation, disability, physical appearance, origin or religion, and in any
form whatsoever (speech, image, text and other). Of course, this is not an
exhaustive list.

Although AFPy aims to promote Python in the French-speaking world, the
association is committed to welcome everyone, whatever their programming
language or mother tongue.

AFPy expects from its members a language and a style adapted to a diverse
audience. Sexual or racist allusions are in no way tolerated, whatever their
medium.

Be polite. Don’t insult anyone. Discrimination and harassment are to be excluded
in writing, visuals, words and actions, whatever their nature (sexual, racist,
religious, social…).

Disrespecting these good manners may lead to the exclusion from the event, at
the sole discretion of one or more organizers, or the association, after
deliberation of the executive committee, as well as from any service proposed by
AFPy (planet AFPy, blog, IRC channels).

The « long » version
++++++++++++++++++++

Scope
~~~~~

These good practices apply within the framework of any event (co-)organized by
AFPy in a direct or indirect way, namely:

- conferences (PyConFr and other)
- IRC, XMPP or other instant messaging channels
- planet AFPy
- AFPy blogs
- mailing lists
- any event where you represent AFPy, including casual meetings (AFPyros,
  Meetups…)

Definition of discrimination
~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~

Discrimination includes, according to French law, “the situation in which, on
the basis of their belonging or not belonging, real or supposed, to an ethnic
group or race, their religion, their beliefs, their age, their disability, their
sexual orientation or gender, a person is treated less favourably than an other
is, has been or will be treated in a comparable situation.” “Any sexually
connoted act, [suffered] by a person and having the object or effect of
violating their dignity or creating an intimidating, hostile, degrading,
humiliating or offensive environment” or “the act of ordering anyone to behave
this way” is therefore prohibited.

Behaviors to avoid (banish ?)
~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~

According to the above definition, we invite you to refrain:

- any inappropriate expression or attitude,
- presenting sexual or shocking (especially violent) images,
- deliberate intimidation, harassment, improper and non-consensual physical
  contact.

Incidents handling
~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~

In case of harassment or discrimination by a participant, the event organizers
or members of the executive committee may immediately take any action they deem
appropriate, up to and including temporary or permanent exclusion from an event.

Reporting
---------

If you are victim or witness of harassment or discrimination against other
participant(s), or fear an incident may occur, contact immediately a member of
the staff (in the case of an event) or of the AFPy executive committee.
