Sponsor PyConFr
===============

**The sponsoring campaign is now closed.**

Patronage allows us each year to cover costs such as safety, hot and cold
drinks, cleaning, video coverage, etc.

PyConFr is organized by volunteers from the francophone Python community and
allows this community to meet, exchange and grow each year.

If you wish to support us financially, you can contact `the treasurer of AFPy
(tresorier@afpy.org) <mailto:tresorier@afpy.org>`_ in order to discuss the
details.

This year, we propose the following amounts and counterparts:
